# fltkhs-fluid-demos

These are examples of building Haskell applications using the Fluid GUI builder to generate Haskell code.

__Update__: The [Hackage package] [2] will no longer be updated. Please either clone
this repo or download it as an archive. The goal is that these demos should always build
with the latest version of [FLTKHS] [1].

## Installation

Since the Hackage package is no longer being updated please download or clone
the repo and build:

```
> git clone http://github.com/deech/fltkhs-fluid-demos
> stack install
> stack exec fltkhs-fluid-tree
```
